Welcome to the Sirens Abyss repository! This project is an exciting underwater adventure game where players explore the depths of the ocean, uncover hidden secrets, and navigate various underwater threats. The primary objective is to retrieve the uranium rod from an old shipwreck and return it to the reactor.

Installation
To get started with Sirens Abyss, clone the repository and open the project in your preferred game development environment:

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sirens-abyss.git
cd sirens-abyss
How to Play
The primary objective is to get to the bottom of the ocean, find the uranium rod in the old shipwreck, and bring it back to the reactor, which you will be guided to. To do all of this, you will need to find depth modules so you can safely travel deeper.

Movement
Movement in Sirens Abyss isn't standard WASD movement. While 'A' and 'D' move the submarine left and right, 'W' and 'S' control the ballast tanks. Press 'W' to lighten the sub and decrease density; any density below 1 will make it float that much harder. The opposite goes for 'S', which will increase density, eventually making the submarine sink.

Gold
Gold is found in the abyss and used to fund the expedition through the purchase of supplies like flares, buoys, and parts. In later updates, new upgrades and gear will also be available for purchase. I am also considering having the gold collected play a part in the density of the submarine.

Tools
The use of tools still needs to be fleshed out. While this is currently considered a lackluster part of the game, the major idea is to use tools to manipulate the environment and unlock previously restricted areas. The demo gives access to all four tools; future updates may block tools behind upgrades.

Switch Tool (E = Cycle Next) (1 = Scanner) (2 = Claw) (3 = Drill) (4 = Saw)

Scanner (1) - Get information on almost any object in the game.

Claw (2) - Move debris and collect loot by pulling them closer to the submarine.

Drill (3) - Break BOLTS that hold together pieces of shipwreck.

Saw (4) - Cut CHAINS and SEAWEED that restrict movement and loot.

Repair (R) - Increase hull integrity. (The demo also allows passive repair at operational bases.)

Flares (F) - Illuminate darker areas for about 10 seconds.

Drop-Weights (J) - Instantly decrease density by 1.

Threats
CRUSH-DEPTH: Keep an eye on the depth gauge; your submarine needs upgrades to reach greater depths.

DEPTH-MINES / CAVESPIKES / DEBRIS: These can damage your HULL INTEGRITY.

PHANTOMS: Dangerous entities that feed on the life force in the abyss.

Phantom Mariners: Scared of light but can be deadly.

Phantom Cephalopods: Release INK that limits light effectiveness.

Phantom Whales: Will consume the submarine if youâ€™re in their way.
