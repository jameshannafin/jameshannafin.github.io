Focus: A tool to centralize and assist in freight fowarding tasks.

There are two main parts of the program;

	The Header stays attached to the top of the screen and provides imediate access to several things.
		
		- Terminals: A link to a sortable list of US ports.
		- Terminals: A link to a sortable list of steam-ship lines.
		- Emails:    A link to Email Section of the main page

	Main Page



Definate Changes to come.
	
	 More prebuilt emails.
		Prebuilt emails are not as easy to add, but more are coming.

		


***
Possible Changes.
Deviate from the one page format and have the different sections split up into several sections.
	As the project expnands, this may become necasary to stay organized
	Pros - Better organization.

	Cons - Slightly slower end-user expierence.
